All genre-based achievements have 4 levels. Count-based badges have 12 levels, and score-based have 3 pseudo-levels. There are some other special badges awarded for achieving something big. In total, we have over 100 images that make you want to watch more anime or read more manga.

If you're curious about titles that count towards certain badges, read [these files](https://github.com/anime-plus/graph/tree/master/data/achievement), but note that some genre-based achievements have their title list generated automatically from genres on myanimelist.net. These can also have additional titles added manually, to fill up genre holes left by myanimelist.net (e.g. sequel to a historical anime isn't tagged as such).

Thresholds for manga/anime genres are 1.5/3% of titles (up to 25/50) for level 1, 3/6% (up to 50/100) for level 2, 6/12% (up to 100/200) for level 3 and 12/24% (up to 200/400) for the maximum level.
